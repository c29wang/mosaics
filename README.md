# Mosaics
A collection of community generated recursive mosaic inscriptions

The first 512 inscriptions that satisfy the following rules will be recognized as valid Mosaics:

- Must be a 100x100 HTML mosaic using inscriptions as tiles (recursive), following the file format generated by the script in this repo. No individual tile can appear more than 10 to 20max times in the mosaic. Number of unique tiles: 500 minium

- Must be inscribed on an uncommon sat (or higher rarity)

- Some of the earnings from the first sale of the piece must be pledged to hodlers of the inscriptions used, as well as to the Ord development fund

## How to generate a mosaic
```
git clone https://github.com/dannydeezy/mosaics
cd mosaics
python3 mosaic.py <YOUR_IMAGE> <LIST_OF_COLLECTION_SLUGS_TO_USE_AS_TILES> "Name of Mosaic"
```

## Examples:
```
python3 mosaic.py ../frogs/coolfrog.webp bitcoin-frogs "We Are All Frogtoshi"
python3 mosaic.py ~/Downloads/MidjourneyArt.jpg  astral-babes,astralchads "Mother Gaia"
```

## Add your collection:
```
python3 download-inscriptions.py <YOUR_COLLECTION_SLUG>
```
example:
```
python3 download-inscriptions.py bitcoin-flowers
```
Then you need to inscribe `ids1.js`, `ids2.js`.. and `colors.js`, and update create a file `info.json` in the `collections/your-slug/` folder (see others)
